Amid the pandemic, there is a lot of misinformation and lack of awareness amongst the masses.

To tackle this issue, and provide the people with the relevant information in a fun manner we are developing a small game.
Through the game, you can put yourself in the shoes of a world leader, and try to control the pandemic with your decisions by swiping left or right to a question. 
On the App’s home page we are showing a real-time graph of current cases affected by the pandemic by web scraping users can click on it to get more relevant data regarding the same. The current graph is inspired by 3blue1brown epidemic video so the link of it showcases his perspective will also be present.

User can click on the play button to get on the game screen where he will be given a card with a question and name title, by swiping left to right the user makes a choice which will affect the 4 factors in the game Economy, Public opinion, Resources, Medical infrastructure.

The goal of the game is to sustain as long as possible without any breakdown in any of the above-mentioned factors. This is inspired by games like Lapse, Reigns, Plague Inc.

The above-mentioned factors will change according to the decision taken in the game. This is just a demonstration in which the factors are currently constant. 
For eg: One of your lead researchers suggests going with human experimentation to improve your chances to combat the pandemic
This question if answered yes will improve medical stats and decrease public opinion stats. Otherwise, it will decrease the medical and economy stats while increasing public opinion stats.

As the goal of the game is to sustain as long as possible(with a probability of finding a cure increasing with time depending on the difficulty level) user will be given different achievements depending upon the play style they choose, and a card to represent the ending they have explored as there will be many unique Endings.

Once an ending is reached, the user is given an option to continue or restart the game, rather than choosing to watch an ad we display an informative card regarding the pandemic to increase their awareness.

We are also exploring the idea of having in-game currency so that the user can utilize it to undo a choice or continue the game on a loss taken while resetting the factor which got depleted. This in-game currency can be obtained by giving a simple quiz regarding the pandemic to even fortify the knowledge of the user and making him more aware.
This model is used by ads to promote their sales in many instances of time, we are planning to use a similar model for once to spread awareness among people while giving them an enjoyable experience through a fun game.
The game will have a rich storyline and game-play, allowing the user to reach multiple endings depending on how they utilize their skills to find the solution for the pandemic. This will keep the user interested in the game while also increasing their awareness regarding the pandemic. Getting Started
